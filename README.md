# ALUMNI

The greatest asset any institution can have been the alumni system. Alumni are people who represent the institution in real world.
The aim of this Alumni Management System project is to build a system that will be able to manage alumni data of a college and provide easy access to the same. Alumni of a college generally stay in touch with their immediate friends but find it hard to stay connected with other college mates.
The Alumni management system (alumni) embodies one of the ways the university can track its graduates. With the exception of university-graduate communication, system must allow communication between the graduate themselves and their personal presentation to a crowd.



## Advantages :-

	Online Registration was designed specifically to facilitate the registration of alumni in the system over the Internet. It includes all the data of the alumni in order for them to navigate all the sub menus.
<br/>	Log-in form is one of the menus in the system. It prompts the user to enter the user name and password for their access. Alumni can be a member if they had signed up and provided necessary information in the alumni profile. For those who are not a member of the system they cannot access the entire menu in the site.
<br/>	User can also search their batch mate using the menu search a soon as they fund it out they can view the profile of it but will not be able to edit the information
